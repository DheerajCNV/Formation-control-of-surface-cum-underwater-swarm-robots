# Formation-control-of-surface-cum-underwater-swarm-robots

In this project, I collaborated with a team of three to engineer an unmanned vehicle to operate in a swarm environment:
\nA literature review was [performed to understand the research on Underwater swarm robots, which helped us gain insights and build on our project.
We designed an unmanned vehicle that can cruise on both surface and water and operate in a swarm environment using a variable buoyancy system based on the shift of mass.
Our team successfully implemented the mathematical models of surface and underwater motion in MATLAB using Simulink.
